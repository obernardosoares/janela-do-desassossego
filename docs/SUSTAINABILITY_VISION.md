## The Problem

| Resource | Global Challenge |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Water** | 2B people lack access; 50% of urban water is wasted |
| **Energy** | 30% of home energy is wasted; fossil fuel dependency |
| **Food** | 40% of food is wasted; industrial agriculture degrades soil |
| **Biodiversity** | Urban expansion destroys habitats; disconnection from nature |

**The root cause**: We consume resources we cannot see, measure, or understand.

## Our Solution

### Make the Invisible Visible

```
┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
│   Sensing    │ →   │   Showing    │ →   │    Saving    │
│              │     │              │     │              │
│ IoT devices  │     │ Mobile app   │     │ Behavior     │
│ capture data │     │ visualizes   │     │ changes      │
└──────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └──────────────┘
```

### Conservation Through Awareness

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Shower until done | See real-time liters → shorter showers |
| Water plants randomly | Soil sensors → water only when needed |
| Lights always on | Presence detection → automatic off |
| Food spoils unseen | Fridge monitoring → reduce waste |

## Measurable Impact

### Per Household (Annual Potential)

| Resource | Typical Waste | Reduction Goal | Savings |
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| **Water** | 50,000 L | 20% reduction | 10,000 L |
| **Electricity** | 4,000 kWh | 15% reduction | 600 kWh |
| **Food Waste** | 100 kg | 30% reduction | 30 kg |
| **CO₂ Equivalent** | — | — | ~500 kg |

### Scale Vision

| Milestone | Households | Annual Water Saved | CO₂ Prevented |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Year 1 | 1,000 | 10M liters | 500 tonnes |
| Year 3 | 50,000 | 500M liters | 25K tonnes |
| Year 5 | 500,000 | 5B liters | 250K tonnes |

## Precision Agriculture at Home

### The Backyard Revolution

Families can grow food sustainably with intelligent monitoring:

| Sensor | Insight | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Soil moisture | Water stress detection | Automated irrigation |
| Camera + ML | Pest/disease identification | Early intervention |
| Weather station | Frost/heat warnings | Protective measures |
| Growth tracking | Harvest timing | Optimal picking |

### Supported Cultivation

- Vegetable gardens and raised beds
- Fruit trees and orchards
- Herbs and microgreens
- Hydroponics and aquaponics
- Greenhouses and polytunnels

## Animal Welfare

### Pets

| Monitoring | Benefit |
|------------|---------|
| Automatic feeders | Consistent nutrition |
| Water level sensors | Always hydrated |
| Activity tracking | Health insights |
| Camera monitoring | Peace of mind |

### Livestock (Small Scale)

| Animal | Monitoring | Outcome |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Chickens | Coop temp, egg counting | Healthier flock |
| Bees | Hive weight, temperature | Colony health |
| Goats/Sheep | GPS, activity | Pasture management |

## Environmental Integration

### Data Sources

| Source | Data Type | Use |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| Local sensors | Microclimate | Hyperlocal predictions |
| Weather APIs | Regional forecast | Planning |
| Satellite | Vegetation indices | Large-scale trends |
| Community | Shared observations | Collective intelligence |

### Ecological Design

- **Low-power devices**: Solar-powered, battery-efficient
- **Durable hardware**: Multi-year lifespan, repairable
- **Minimal cloud**: Local processing, reduced data center load
- **Open source**: Community-driven sustainability

## The Philosophy of Enough

We don't believe in unlimited growth. We believe in:

- **Enough water** for showers that refresh, not deplete
- **Enough energy** to live comfortably, not wastefully
- **Enough food** grown locally, consumed mindfully
- **Enough data** to understand, not surveil

## Join the Movement

This is not a product. It's a practice.

Every sensor placed is a commitment to awareness.
Every reading viewed is a step toward responsibility.
Every resource saved is a gift to the future.

*Save Earth. Measure life. Live thoughtfully.*
